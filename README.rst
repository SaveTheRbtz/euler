=====
This is my new solutions to Project Euler tasks. Why new? Couple of years back I've
helped one guy learn Python by giving him Euler tasks and verifying results.

Old repository can be found here: https://github.com/Shanjohn/Euler

Since then I've rarely find time to Euler again but when I do - it's always
fun!

What Project Euler is?
======================
You'd better see it yourself: https://projecteuler.net/about

Brief description is::

    A series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will
    require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
